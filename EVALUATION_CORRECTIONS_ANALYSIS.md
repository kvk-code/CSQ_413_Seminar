## Verification Status

✅ All corrections have been applied to the evaluation sheets  
✅ Roll numbers now match guide_seminar_mark_sheet.csv  
✅ Student names verified as correct in all sheets  
✅ Presentation titles standardized across all evaluation sheets  

---

## Recommendations

1. **Review Friday Group 19 Data**: The completely wrong titles for all three students suggests possible data source confusion. Verify that the cybersecurity topics are indeed correct per the latest student submissions.

2. **Implement Data Validation**: Consider adding validation checks to prevent:
   - Empty title fields
   - Roll number mismatches
   - Duplicate/conflicting student data

3. **Standardize Title Entry**: Create a centralized reference list of finalized titles to be used across all evaluation sheets.

4. **Regular Audits**: Before each evaluation session, cross-check all evaluation sheets against the master guide_seminar_mark_sheet.csv.
