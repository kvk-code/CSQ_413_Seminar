# CSQ413 Seminar: Guidelines for S7 CSE (2021-25 Batch) 

- Each student should give a seminar on a scientific topic/ technology of current interest in consultation with the project guide. The topic for a UG seminar should be current and broad based rather than a very specific research work. It's advisable to choose a topic for the Seminar to be closely linked to the final year project area. Every member of the project team could choose or be assigned Seminar topics that covers various aspects linked to the Project area.

Example Topic: "Explainable AI - Concepts and the Future trends"

- Each student should get the prior approval from the guide regarding the topic of the seminar before presentation.
- Each student shall collect sufficient literature on the topic (refer at least 2 to 3 papers), read and understand them thoroughly and present in the class.

For our example topic, you can refer some reputed papers like
[1]. Longo, L., Goebel, R., Lecue, F., Kieseberg, P., \& Holzinger, A. (2020, August). Explainable artificial intelligence: Concepts, applications, research challenges and visions. In International cross-domain conference for machine learning and knowledge extraction (pp. 1-16). Cham: Springer International Publishing.
[2]. Gaspar, D., Silva, P., \& Silva, C. (2024). Explainable AI for Intrusion Detection Systems: LIME and SHAP Applicability on Multi-Layer Perceptron. IEEE Access.
[3]. Zhang, H., \& Ogasawara, K. (2023). Grad-CAM-based explainable artificial intelligence related to medical text processing. Bioengineering, 10(9), 1070.

Here the first paper belongs to category of review/survey papers which discusses a concept and all its existing literature. Other two discusses application of different Explainable AI methods to real world problems.

While choosing papers you should ensure that the papers chosen are from indexed journals/tier-1 conferences (not earlier than 2022). Only one paper referred to may be a survey/review paper. The other should be a methodology/algorithm/design with results.

AY 2024-25
Then for the seminar presentation on the above topic, your contents can be:
$>$ Introduction (Refer review paper)
$>$ Explainable AI Methods (Refer review paper)
$>$ Discussion on Recent Results/ Recent Applications (Comprehend Other 2 papers)
$>$ Conclusion (Your own inferences upon studying about this topic)
[NB: This is just a sample. You can add/drop/modify according to your topic and as per the instructions from your guide]

- Students should submit a handout of the slides which is verified \& signed by the guide and a hard copy of the papers referred, before the presentation. A soft copy of the handout along with the papers referred must be uploaded in the Google Classroom created for the course.
- Students must prepare a detailed report on the topic of the seminar and submit it towards the end of the semester.
- The seminar is to be of 20 minutes duration with another 5 minutes given for questions and answers.
- Evaluation will be based on the report, seminar presentation, the ability of the student to answer the question, the participation of the student by asking questions when others are presenting and attendance.
- Each student shall maintain a seminar diary (a small notebook) whose contents are as follows:

| Week (date range) | Your works description | Guide sign and remarks |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |

This must have entries till the report submission.

- We will start our seminar from 30/07/2024 onwards - 6 students/session.
