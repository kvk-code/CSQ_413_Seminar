**What it measures:**
- Number and quality of references
- Recency of papers (2022+)
- Proper citation format
- Mix of reference types
- No plagiarism

## Alignment with Course Outcomes

| Course Outcome | Report Component | Alignment |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| CO1: Identify academic documents | Adequacy of References | Direct - choosing quality papers |
| CO2: Read and apprehend | Technical Content | Direct - demonstrating understanding |
| CO3: Prepare presentation | Overall Quality (partially) | Indirect - communication skills |
| CO4: Give presentation | N/A | Not applicable to report |
| CO5: Prepare technical report | All components | Direct - complete report creation |

## Consistency with Existing Rubrics

The detailed splitup maintains consistency with:

1. **Syllabus (CSQ413_Seminar_Syllabus.md)**
   - Total 20 marks for report maintained
   - Focus on "technical content, overall quality, templates followed, adequacy of references"
   - Aligned with course objectives

2. **Main Rubrics (Rubrics for Seminar_21.07.2025.md)**
   - Row 37-43 describes report evaluation criteria
   - Four performance levels maintained (Poor, Fair, Very Good, Outstanding)
   - Criteria expanded into quantifiable metrics

3. **Guidelines (CSQ413 Seminar Guidelines.md)**
   - Reference requirements (2-3 papers, recent, peer-reviewed)
   - Template adherence requirements
   - Professional presentation standards

## Usage Workflow

### For Evaluators (IEC Members):
1. **Before Evaluation:** Review `Report_Evaluation_Rubrics.md`
2. **During Evaluation:** Use `detailed_evaluation_sheet.csv` for marking
3. **Quick Reference:** Keep `Report_Evaluation_Quick_Reference.md` handy
4. **Record:** Fill in marks for each of the 4 components
5. **Total:** Sum up to get Report Total (out of 20)

### For Students:
1. **Planning Phase:** Review `Report_Evaluation_Quick_Reference.md` to understand requirements
2. **Writing Phase:** Refer to `Report_Evaluation_Rubrics.md` for detailed criteria
3. **Self-Check:** Use evaluation checklist before submission
4. **Target:** Aim for Outstanding level in each component

### For Seminar Coordinator:
1. **Distribution:** Share Quick Reference with all students at course start
2. **Training:** Use comprehensive rubrics to train IEC members
3. **Standardization:** Ensure consistent evaluation across all reports
4. **Record-Keeping:** Use detailed evaluation sheet for documentation
