## Detailed Subsection Mapping

### CO1: Identify Promising New Directions of Cutting-Edge Technologies

**Subsection:** Topic Relevance (TR) - **10 marks**

**Rationale:**
- Students must identify and select a topic that represents a cutting-edge technology direction
- The guide evaluates how well the student's chosen topic aligns with emerging technology trends
- This assessment is conducted during the selection phase and is part of the Guide's evaluation

**Related Evaluation Component:** Seminar Guide Evaluation

---

### CO2: Read and Comprehend Research Papers

**Subsection:** Background Knowledge (BK) - **10 marks**

**Rationale:**
- Demonstrates the student's ability to read and comprehend academic literature
- The guide assesses depth of understanding through knowledge demonstration
- Reflects the student's grasp of the research papers and related background material
- Evaluated based on the student's discussion during guide interactions

**Related Evaluation Component:** Seminar Guide Evaluation

---

### CO3: Effectively Communicate by Making an Oral Presentation

**Subsections:** 
- Organization (Org) - **10 marks**
- Clarity & Communication (C&C) - **10 marks**
- **Total: 20 marks**

**Rationale:**
- **Organization (10):** Reflects how well the student structures the presentation (slide organization, logical flow, proper formatting)
- **Clarity & Communication (10):** Reflects the student's ability to communicate concepts clearly, language proficiency, and delivery effectiveness
- Together, these components assess the overall quality of oral presentation delivery

**Related Evaluation Component:** Presentation Evaluation (IEC)

---

### CO4: Demonstrate Listening Ability and Respond Constructively

**Subsections:**
- Q&A (Questions & Answers) - **10 marks**
- Overall Participation (OP) - **10 marks**
- **Total: 20 marks**

**Rationale:**
- **Q&A (10):** Directly tests the student's ability to listen to questions and respond constructively during their own presentation Q&A session
- **Overall Participation (10):** Assesses the student's listening skills and constructive engagement during other students' presentations
- Combined, these evaluate both individual response capability and peer engagement

**Related Evaluation Component:** Presentation Evaluation (IEC) + Coordinator Assessment

---

### CO5: Develop Skills in Preparing Well-Organized Report with Technical Writing & Critical Thinking

**Subsections:**
- Technical Content (TC) - **8 marks**
- Overall Quality (OQ) - **5 marks**
- Templates Followed (TF) - **4 marks**
- Adequacy of References (AR) - **3 marks**
- Seminar Diary (SD) - **10 marks**
- **Total: 30 marks**

**Rationale:**

**Report Components (20 marks):**
- **Technical Content (8):** Evaluates the depth and accuracy of technical understanding demonstrated in the report
- **Overall Quality (5):** Assesses writing quality, grammar, readability, and professional presentation
- **Templates Followed (4):** Ensures adherence to formatting standards and organizational structure
- **Adequacy of References (3):** Validates source material quality, recency (2022+), proper citations, and alignment with requirements

**Seminar Diary Component (10 marks):**
- **Seminar Diary (10):** A weekly documentation record that demonstrates ongoing technical writing and critical reflection
- Serves as a companion to the final report - both are forms of technical documentation
- Requires systematic organization, clarity, and critical thinking in recording progress and insights
- Integrates with report preparation as part of the overall documentation and writing skill development

**Related Evaluation Components:** Report Evaluation (IEC) + Coordinator Assessment (Diary)

## Alignment with FINAL_CONSOLIDATED_MARKS.csv

The mapping directly corresponds to columns in FINAL_CONSOLIDATED_MARKS.csv:

**Guide Total (20) = BK (10) + TR (10)**
- CO2 + CO1

**Coordinator Total (20) = SD (10) + Att (10)**
- CO5 + Attendance

**Presentation Total (40) = Org (10) + C&C (10) + Q&A (10) + OP (10)**
- CO3 + CO3 + CO4 + CO4

**Report Total (20) = TC (8) + OQ (5) + TF (4) + AR (3)**
- CO5 + CO5 + CO5 + CO5

**GRAND TOTAL (100) = Guide (20) + Coordinator (20) + Presentation (40) + Report (20)**
- All COs + Attendance

## Key Mapping Principles

1. **No Subsection Overlap:** Each evaluation subsection maps to exactly one CO
2. **Complete Coverage:** All 90 mark subsections (excluding Attendance) are aligned with course outcomes
3. **Logical Grouping:** Related subsections are grouped under the same CO for coherent assessment
4. **Seminar Diary Integration:** Seminar Diary (weekly documentation) is mapped to CO5 as it represents ongoing technical writing practice supporting report preparation
5. **Attendance Support:** Attendance (10 marks) is assessed as a course compliance metric supporting overall engagement but not directly tied to specific learning outcomes
